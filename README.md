# PCA Generator

Welcome to the PCA Plot Generator ðŸ‘‹!

This application is designed to simplify the process of generating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots, scree plot, and loadings table.

The application can be used as:
- **a standalone tool** 

    OR 

- **a plugin in Micromix** (http://micromix.helmholtz-hiri.de/). 

Detailed instructions for installation and independent operation can be found in the section below.

When integrated into Micromix, the application operates within an `<iframe>` tag. It retrieves a `config` number from the Micromix URL. The `config` number is then used to access the Micromix MongoDB. The data corresponding to the `config` number is fetched and loaded into the application for further use.
