## Features

### 1. Tool bar

- `Begin a tour`: This button will start a brief walkthrough, guiding you through the functionalities of each button.
- `Upload file`: Use this to upload your file.
- `Scree plot`: A scree plot in PCA is a chart that shows the eigenvalues (variances) of each principal component in descending order. It helps identify the optimal number of principal components by locating the point where the decrease in eigenvalues becomes less significant, often called the ‚Äúelbow‚Äù point.
- `PCA plot`: PCA is a statistical technique used in data analysis for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets. The way PCA does this is by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, which are called the Principal Components (PC). These PC are ordered so that the first few retain most of the variability in all of the original variables.
- `Loadings table`: In PCA, a loadings table shows the contribution of each original variable to each principal component. The larger the absolute value (positive or negative) of a loading, the stronger the influence of the corresponding variable on the respective component.
- `Top 5 contributors`: The top-5-contributors typically lists the five variables that contribute the most to each principal component. The contribution of a variable is determined by its loading, with larger absolute values indicating stronger contributions.
- `Clear`: Clear all the plots and tables.

### 2. Examples

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature-Scree_Plot_Generation-blue)

Determine the number of principal components to retain in your analysis. This plot displays the proportion of total variance in the data for each principal component.

In the scree plot, the **vertical line** represents a critical point in the analysis of PCA. This line is typically drawn at the point where the cumulative variance exceeds a certain threshold, in this case, 80%.

The **vertical line** is a visual aid that helps you quickly identify the number of principal components needed to capture a significant amount of the variance in the data.

A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot is a powerful tool in the field of bioinformatics and other areas of biology where large and complex datasets are common. It‚Äôs particularly useful in studies where the goal is to compare different biological conditions, such as healthy vs. diseased, treated vs. untreated, or different stages of a biological process.

PCA works by reducing the dimensionality of the data. In other words, it takes a dataset with many variables (such as gene expression levels for thousands of genes) and simplifies it into just a few ‚Äúprincipal components‚Äù that capture the majority of the variation in the data.

The PCA plot visualizes these principal components. Each point on the plot represents a sample, and the position of the point is determined by the values of the principal components. This allows you to see at a glance how similar or different the samples are.

One of the key benefits of a PCA plot is that it can help to separate different biological conditions. If the conditions have distinct gene expression profiles, they will cluster separately on the PCA plot. This can provide a clear visual confirmation of the differences between the conditions.

#### PCA 2D

üé® You can change the color of points on the PCA plot according to your own preferences. Each point represents one sample in your data.
