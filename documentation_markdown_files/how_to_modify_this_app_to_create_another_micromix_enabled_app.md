## How to modify this app to create another Micromix enabled app

The PCA is built based on the [React Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/)

Basically, the plot will change when we change the `data` and `layout` in the `<Plot />` component. So you can modify the `data` and the `layout` to make different plots such as bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, etc.

More information about `data` and `layout` can be found here:

- `data`: https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/
- `layout`: https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/#layout
